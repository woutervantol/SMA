Introduction to the problem
Background information
Research question
Approach
 - Gravity code
 - Hydro code
 - Stellar winds links to hydro code (and is derived from the bodies)
 - Stellar evolution links to the bodies (SeBa())
Parameters: what are they and why did we choose them
 - Initialization:
   - Bodies initialization:
     - Fractal distribution
     - Number of bodies
     - Salpeter mass distribution
     - Setting heaviest star mass for consistent supernova forming
     - cluster radius
   - Gas initialization:
     - Plummer sphere
     - number of gas particles
     - create cheese based on star mass, to sort of simulate star forming
   - Star mass/gas mass ratio and its effect
   - Wait for virial equilibrium, then start the process
 - Timesteps
 - ?

When we run the code
 - Video of the simulation
 - Specify moment of supernova
 - Note the wind you see flying and possibly accelerated gas particles.

Post processing
 - What actually happened?
 - Looking at total energy
	 - Perhaps comparing situation without stellar winds and with stellar winds
 - Number of original gas particles
 - Looking at gas velocities
 - Looking at body velocities?

Conclusion:
 - What is the actual effect of the winds?
 - With this, can we say something about the two branches of stellar clusters?
 - What is the effect of stellar wind, and in particular a supernova on the boundness of a stellar cluster?

 - Deleting out of bounds particles
