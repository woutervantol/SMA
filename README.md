TODO: make readme file with names as snumbers and everything below:
take a mass fucntion (salpeter) and 1000 stars, maybe 1 30 solar mass starr or tune such that we have at least 1 large star. Take a fractal distribution of stars since it is less bound and stable. take gas plummer sphere around this distribtion of stars. 
as initial conditions eat away the gas around the stars proportional to the mass of the stars, like a swiss cheese. 
we need star evolution, use SEBA, for extra points we can use MESA, use 10000 shp particles
one of our problems is the bridge timesteps after a supernova starts, then we can use 1000 or 10000 years timesteps
make the most massive star 30 solar masses and change it to virial equilibrium
Is the gas blown away by the stellar winds or by the supernova?
What is the contribution of the supernova to clearing the gas?
present 14th december, deadline is 23rd of december
see if the swiss cheese approach is realistic
