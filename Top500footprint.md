LUMI, the third fasterst supercomputer in the world, is also the third greenest supercomputer on the green500. This supercomputer, located in Kajaani, Sweden, reaches a peak performance of 550 petaflops. This is equal to 550 quintillion (550*10^15) calculations per second. 
Using https://green-algorithms.org/ which I found via https://physicsworld.com/a/the-huge-carbon-footprint-of-large-scale-computing/, I estimate that the LUMI uses around 23,5 kg CO2e (CO2 equivalent) per second of computing time.
This results in a carbon foorprint of 4.3*10^-17 kg/flop
